<p>Jenkins can load Valgrind XML reports. When this option is configured,
Jenkins can provide useful information about memory leaks, such as
historical result trend, web UI for viewing the leaks, and so on.</p>
<p>This plug-in is not invoked for failed builds, it is only called
for stable or unstable builds (i.e., a build with failed tests).</p>
